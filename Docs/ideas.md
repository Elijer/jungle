# Drawing
Users could draw with mouse or on touchscreen and then place their drawings as strokes in space.

# Voice
users could talk to one another with spatial audio - maybe even only talking to someone you are right next to, and I could call it "whisper". But what would the point be? What would you even do with that ability? Well it'd be kinda interesting. Cause you wouldn't know who you were talking to.

In a room, it'd be hectic. But it'd definitely be interesting.
