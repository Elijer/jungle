# To Run
For a hotreaload development setup run
- cd into server and run `npm run server`
- cd into client and run `npm run dev`
And navigate to http://localhost:5173/ or whatever is specified in the terminal

Or to preview the deployment build, do
`npm run start` and go to  `localhost:3000`

OR
Do `heroku local` if you have Heroku setup. But you'd have to do that.
